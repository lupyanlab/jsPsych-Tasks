  The HIT you are about to do is sponsored by University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is part of a
  protocol titled “Language and Human Cognition”. The task you are asked to do involves making
  simple responses to images, text, and/or sounds. For example, you may be asked how typical a
  picture of a dog is of dogs in general, to name a drawing, decide what word a sound makes you
  think of, to choose which visual pattern best completes a sequence of patterns, or indicate how
  vividly you see in your “mind’s eye."
  <strong>HIT instructions will be provided on the next screen. </strong>
