    make judgments about them. For example, you may be asked how typical apicture of a dog is of
    dogs in general, or to identify an ambiguous drawing, decide what word asound makes you think
    of, to choose which visual pattern best completes a sequence of patterns, or indicate how
    vividly you see in your “mind’s eye.”
